# AES
This project provides an implementation of the AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) encryption and decryption algorithm in C++. AES is a widely used encryption standard known for its strong security features. This implementation showcases the encryption and decryption process using the AES 128 symmetric key algorithm. This project was built as an extension of my passion for cybersecurity and a tool for practising my C++ skills after completing CPS393 (intro to Unix, C and C++).

## Features

- AES-128 decryption.
- Key expansion to generate round keys.
- Decryption of input ciphertext.
- Output of decrypted plaintext in hexadecimal format.
